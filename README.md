# Markov Decision Process - Pathfinding Algorithm for Autonomous Agent



### Scenario
Given an nxn map with empty, start, goal, and hazard positions (denoted with 0, 1, 2, & 3 respectively), find the utility (value) and the optimal move (policy) at each position. A robot uses this information to delivery its payload to the goal position, beginning at the start position.
